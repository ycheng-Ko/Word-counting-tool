It's necessary for all the students having enough common sense, but study the same curriculum until they enter the college is not the only way to achieve the goal. I recommend taking the same curriculumn until the senior high school. It can takes part of two aspects to discuss.

For the common sense students need, we can think of the humanity - we can not live without others in the current society. We need to communicate with others, like buying the food. We also need the basic judge the "word" what the merchant want to talk to us. If the merchant sell the sandwiches in a lower price and I pay the twice money just because of the wrong recognition. It'll be the joke. Also, I think it is important for student knowing the place where they live. The background knowledge not only make us know the geographic for normal transport but also make us comprehend different people from us. The community need more sympathy so that the country won't be in the hatred.

For the variety in students, there must be some students specialize in specific skill. We can not expect a person be the super hero who had trained just for few years. I think the junior high's education is enough for the basic interaction in life. So student specializing in skills can study deeply in his or her skills, and student in normal can keep studying the basic class, which let students clarify their interest. Student do have choice whether to study in general or in special skill after graduating the junior high school. The nation needs the specialist for conducting the science, and also needs the person who can work in a cross-functional team.

As for the reason I recommend the different ways in senior high, the person who has been seen as an adult that can drive cars, smoking and the like while people are 18 in Taiwan. I'm not specialize in the human growth and the recognise in each age, but I believe the person who make the Taiwanese law. If we have the authority to choose the behavior what we want to do after 18, we do have the authority to make the choice for our education or our lives.

We need to lead child who do not have enough sense for their growth or education when they are child, but adult have to choose the way what they are going to be. After having enough common sense from elementary school. To learn as a specialist or a cross-functional person, it is decided by themselves.
